    Users should have preference to include or exclude public groups they arent members of from their dropdown
    styling (which can totally be one big story at the end .... not)
  4/25
    map it! functionality automatically appears on a search result set with objects that have "latlong" preferences/attributes
  5/2
    category should have an "unsearchable" boolean that turns them off for the search page, so things like latlong, description, and whatever can exist as LPV values that get listed on the show page for the ling
    lpv mass setting page should sort properties by category like search does

bulk upload data
  one per table, another for parentage?
  upload in a second window
  pass/fail on whole dataset
  look for form upload fields/helpers
  meta refresh tag
  note: child lings always require parent lings, no exceptions
  examples also require lings

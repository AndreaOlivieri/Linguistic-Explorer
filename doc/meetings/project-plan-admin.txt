    Cleanup  - indices on tables
    Feature  - map it! functionality automatically appears on a search result set with objects that have "latlong" preferences/attributes
    Cleanup  - Do not display depth selectors anywhere (reference type names), do not allow or show the option of depth change post record creation
    Chore    - upgrade to rails 3.1.0 (requires dealing with many deprecation warnings, likely)
    Refactor - extract stored_values into a module
    Refactor - Decide whether ExamplesValues deserve a mass setting page like Values have (select the example, it finds the ling and all LingsProperties for the ling and lets you select any) and potentially remove the whole ELP controller

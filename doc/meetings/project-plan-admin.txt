  5/2
    hook in RPM, Hoptoad, etc.
    map it! functionality automatically appears on a search result set with objects that have "latlong" preferences/attributes
    refine tests into documentation
    remove, resolve, or document TODO notes
    write higher level explanation of database architecture
    write sample plans for arbitrary-depth expansion
    write testing style/practices guide (routing, controller, permission, model, features general, troubleshooting)
    write guide for how to: run all tests, run a single test, create the dbs, seed the db, drLop and recreate/seed the db

  Non-Essential
    Cleanup - Do not display depth selectors anywhere (reference type names), do not allow or show the option of depth change post record creation
    Chore - remove XML responses everywhere if they aren't specifically required by dennis
    Chore - upgrade to rails 3.1.0 (requires dealing with many deprecation warnings, likely)
    Refactor - extract stored_values into a module
    Cleanup - there should be stored_values on Lings (varying by depth!)
    Admin - site administrative pages for all data types ungrouped
    Cleanup - consider renaming "LingsProperty" everywhere to "Value" (ExampleLP => ExampleValue)
    Cleanup - Users should have preference to include or exclude public groups they arent members of from their dropdown
    Cleanup - Memberships should not have edit/update (potentially true for ExamplesValues and LingsProperties)
    Refactor - Determine whether the LingsPropertyController is useful now that mass setting is preset
    Cleanup - Make mass value setting columnar with categories or make checkbox dropdowns/smaller footprint lists
    Refactor - Decide whether ExamplesValues deserve a mass setting page like Values have (select the example, it finds the ling and all LingsProperties for the ling and lets you select any)
    Refactor - Determine whether the ExamplesLingsPropertyController is worthwhile in place of just having them create a set of links for examples and lings_properties
    Cleanup - Memberships should pre-filter the create/new options to non-members, or make it a text field where you have to enter an email
    JS - jasmine integration and sample tests
    JS - data tables integration (requires jquery)

bulk upload data
  one per table, another for parentage?
  upload in a second window
  pass/fail on whole dataset
  look for form upload fields/helpers
  meta refresh tag
  note: child lings always require parent lings, no exceptions
  examples also require lings

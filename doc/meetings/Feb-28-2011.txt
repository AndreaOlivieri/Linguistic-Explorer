  Alex should add integration tests (Cucumber scenarios) for the following:
  - Registration errors
  - User login
  - User login errors
  - Group create/edit/destroy + errors
  
  We need an updated CSV for seed data that includes the Category table. Alex has provided info for Dennis via email.
  
  Ross will clean up the existing query logic with the changes to categories and depths. He'll also begin figuring out a deploy strategy and setting up a QA environment. This may set back the slated work on searching on properties by "ALL".
